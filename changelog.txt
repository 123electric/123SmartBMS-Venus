v1.9 - 4-11-2022
-Decreased balancing time by better detection of when battery is full and balanced
-Better discharge algorithm. When almost empty, keep DCL at 0A until voltage is 100mV higher and after some time
-Increased imbalance detection from 40mV to 50mV and from 10 to 20 minutes

v1.8 - 21-10-2022
-Added extra conditions when to rebalance, to support generators which stop when the battery is totally full (around Vfull)
-Better charge algorithm. When recharging, lower CVL extra when near Vmax. Added hysteresis for this.

v1.7 - 3-10-2022
-Bugfix: quit program when dbus thread gives exception (should not happen but for extra safety)

v1.6 - 16-9-2022
-Added PI loop for undervoltage protection to keep the lowest cell a little above Vmin
-Decreased rebalance time from 4 days to 11 hours to be able to recharge
-Set CVL to 3.37V per cell after fully charged - for LiFePO4
-Removed USB lost timeout as it seems it was not needed
-Changed from serial.tools.list_ports to os.path.exists to see if ttyUSB exists because list_ports seems to give a problem with GUI
-Added test version like v1.6~3 to Victron version GUI display
-Moved DBus monitor to separate thread. Stops weird DBus behaviour and makes everything a lot faster

v1.5 - 19-7-2022
-Smoothed TTG for low current to reduce the large fluctuations
-Added USB lost timeout because the detection sometimes falsely trigged the software shutdown

v1.4 - 7-7-2022
-Added extra USB lost detection as sometimes the USB could be lost but the code kept running

v1.3 - 27-6-2022
-Fixed bug in Manager which occured when a non-123 SoC was selected as main SoC
-Added PackageManager no-reboot support from Victron VenusOS v2.90~3+

v1.2 - 28-2-2022
This is an internal version for beta testing
-Added multi worker support with one Manager. The Manager takes the value from the Workers and calculates the DVCC values

v1.1 - 23-12-2021
-Added support for kwindrems PackageManager

v1.0 - 20-12-2021
-Added DVCC parameters

v0.9 - 16-11-2021
-First working version, displaying data on the console and VRM
