v1.11 - 8-2-2024
-Added support for optional key-value pairs for the SmartBMS. This enables extra data to be received like SoH etc
-Added firmware version display (from firmware v3.3.6)
-Added charge cycle display (from firmware v3.3.6)
-Added total charge and discharge kWh (from firmware v3.3.6)
-Added SoH display (from firmware v3.3.6)
-Discharge now limits/stops when the lowest cell voltage is a little under Vlow (instead of a little over Vmin). This can be handy when you set the Vmin at almost empty, for example 2.8V and Vlow with a little spare energy (2.97V). The battery voltage will then stay around Vlow and thus will not exceed Vmin and thus will not trigger the BMS to switch off the power relay

v1.10 - 8-5-2023
-Round battery installed capacity per Ah as the resolution of the incoming battery data converted to Ah is about 1.8 - 2Ah for 48V
-Round available capacity to per 0.1Ah
-Bugfix: battery installed capacity and capacity were not completely correct due to slightly off LFP nominal voltage
-Increased BMS last seen timeout to 60 seconds as that is still safe enough and may avoid false BMS lost alarms

v1.9 - 4-11-2022
-Decreased balancing time by better detection of when battery is full and balanced
-Better discharge algorithm. When almost empty, keep DCL at 0A until voltage is 100mV higher and after some time
-Increased imbalance detection from 40mV to 50mV and from 10 to 20 minutes

v1.8 - 21-10-2022
-Added extra conditions when to rebalance, to support generators which stop when the battery is totally full (around Vfull)
-Better charge algorithm. When recharging, lower CVL extra when near Vmax. Added hysteresis for this.

v1.7 - 3-10-2022
-Bugfix: quit program when dbus thread gives exception (should not happen but for extra safety)

v1.6 - 16-9-2022
-Added PI loop for undervoltage protection to keep the lowest cell a little above Vmin
-Decreased rebalance time from 4 days to 11 hours to be able to recharge
-Set CVL to 3.37V per cell after fully charged - for LiFePO4
-Removed USB lost timeout as it seems it was not needed
-Changed from serial.tools.list_ports to os.path.exists to see if ttyUSB exists because list_ports seems to give a problem with GUI
-Added test version like v1.6~3 to Victron version GUI display
-Moved DBus monitor to separate thread. Stops weird DBus behaviour and makes everything a lot faster

v1.5 - 19-7-2022
-Smoothed TTG for low current to reduce the large fluctuations
-Added USB lost timeout because the detection sometimes falsely trigged the software shutdown

v1.4 - 7-7-2022
-Added extra USB lost detection as sometimes the USB could be lost but the code kept running

v1.3 - 27-6-2022
-Fixed bug in Manager which occured when a non-123 SoC was selected as main SoC
-Added PackageManager no-reboot support from Victron VenusOS v2.90~3+

v1.2 - 28-2-2022
This is an internal version for beta testing
-Added multi worker support with one Manager. The Manager takes the value from the Workers and calculates the DVCC values

v1.1 - 23-12-2021
-Added support for kwindrems PackageManager

v1.0 - 20-12-2021
-Added DVCC parameters

v0.9 - 16-11-2021
-First working version, displaying data on the console and VRM
